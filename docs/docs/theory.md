# Definitions
The conventional gun accelerates a <u>projectile</u> (or <u>shot</u>) down the <u>bore</u> through the 
<u>combustion</u> of a certain amount of <u>propellant</u> (or <u>charge</u>), which is loaded into the
<u>chamber</u>. 

# Measurement Conventions
<u>chamber volume</u> $V_0$: the sealed volume between the breech and the base of projectile 
 at its initial position.

<u>travel</u> (or <u>displacement</u>), $x$: measured base to base against its initial position. 
 projectile must be obturated, i.e. excludes travel in throat & muzzle device.
