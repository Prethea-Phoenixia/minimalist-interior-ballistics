# Definitions
The conventional gun accelerates a <u>projectile</u> (or <u>shot</u>) down the <u>bore</u> through the 
<u>combustion</u> of a certain amount of <u>propellant</u> (or <u>charge</u>), which is loaded into the
<u>chamber</u>. 

For the purpose of interior ballistics, <u>chamber volume</u> refers to the maximum extent to
which the combustion gas can expand to occupy without the projectile moving.

The projectile's <u>travel</u> (or <u>displacement</u>) is measured base to base against 
its initial position.
