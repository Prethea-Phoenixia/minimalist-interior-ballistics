# Propellant

## Work Capacity
The <u>force</u> (or <u>specific energy</u>) metric measures the work that is done when 
the gas product, generated by burning a unit mass of energetics, is expended in
an adiabatic, reversible manner. 

Equivalently, it is the difference between the energy and enthalpy of gas product produced
by the combustion of a unit mass of energetics, at its adiabatic isochoric (constant volume)
flame temperature.

In practice, the tabulated value is derived from ballistics testing via an instrument known as 
a ballistic "bomb", at some standard load density, with the result valid for a range of load
density close to the experimental condition.

## Burn Rate
Combustion progress normal to the surfaces of propellant grains, at a rate proportional to 
pressure, according to the Viellie's Law:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}e = u_0 P^n
$$

Where:

* $e$ propellant web
* $u_0$ burn-rate coefficient
* $P$ mean pressure
* $n$ pressure exponent

## Pressure Gradient
Propellant gas behaviour behind the projectile is a complex matter. Recent approach adopts
CFD like methods, treats propellant-gas mixture as mixed-phase flow, and simulates fluctuation
in 2D space. 

Historically, additional simplifying assumptions were required to yield tractable solution. 
Stipulating instantaneous diffusion of the combustion gas product in an iso-density manner, and 
analyzing with pseudo-steady-state newtonian dynamics yields a distribution of gas velocity 
and pressure according to the Lagrange gradient, where:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{P_{gas}(d)}{P_{proj}} &= [1 + \frac{w}{2\varphi_1 m} (\frac{d}{d_{proj}})^2 ] \\
\frac{v_{gas}(d)}{v_{proj}} &= \frac{d}{d_{proj}}
\end{aligned}
$$
Where:

* $v$: velocity
* $P$: pressure
* $d$: depth of the gas column $d = x + l_0$
  * $x$: displacement
  * $l_0$: equivalent chamber length
* $w$: mass of propellant
* $m$: mass of projectile
* $\varphi_1$: projectile work factor
